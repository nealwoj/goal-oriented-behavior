Neal Wojtowicz - Goal Oriented Behavior
Developed during the Fall 2021 semester at Champlain College

This demo is based on a blog post about Goal Oriented Behavior and was a final project for an Game AI class. It includes a Unity project showcasing goal oriented behavior, a behavior system for AI agents in games. Each agent has a goal system attached and will change goals and corresponding actions using basic fuzzy logic. Each goal/action has an intrinsic value associated that is essentially the priority of the goal/action, and will make decisions based on those values (highest value is deemed most important). In the demo, an AI agent will chase, shoot, or reload depending on its goal and action. Use WASD to move around and press enter to spawn more enemies.
